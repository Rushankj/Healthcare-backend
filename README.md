# Healthcare Backend API

A Django REST backend for healthcare management. Built this for a personal project to learn more about Django REST Framework.

## What's this?
This is a healthcare backend system I built with Django and DRF, using JWT auth (SimpleJWT package). Includes models for patients, doctors, and mappings between them.

## Project Structure
```
healthcare-backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ env/                             # Your Python virtual environment
â”œâ”€â”€ healthcaree/                     # Main Django project folder (created via startproject)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manage.py                    # Django management script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env                         # (Optional) Environment variables file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/                        # Your Django app for healthcare logic
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admin.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apps.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ serializers.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ urls.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ migrations/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ healthcare/                 # Django settings module (same name as the project)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ settings.py             # Project settings (configured with PostgreSQL, JWT, etc.)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ urls.py
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ wsgi.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt                # (Optional) List of installed packages

```

## Features
- JWT Auth (login/logout) - nothing fancy but it works
- Patient CRUD operations 
- Doctor management
- Patient-Doctor mapping (because patients need doctors!)

## Setup (the usual Django stuff)

1. Clone it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd healthcare-backed
```

2. Virtual env
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Get the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Migrations
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Make a superuser (you'll need this)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. Fire it up!
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## API Endpoints

Here are the main endpoints - pretty standard REST stuff:

* **Login:** `POST /api/auth/login/`
* **Patients:** `GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/patients/`
* **Doctors:** `GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/doctors/`
* **Mappings:** `GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/mappings/`

You can use tools like Postman or curl to test these endpoints after getting your JWT token.

## Some JSON examples

### Login
```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

### Create a Patient
```json
{
  "user": 1,  // usually the logged-in user's ID
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "gender": "Male",
  "address": "123 Main Street"
}
```

### Create a Doctor
```json
{
  "user": 1,
  "name": "Dr. Jane Smith",
  "specialty": "Cardiology",
  "phone": "123-456-7890"
}
```

### Map Patient to Doctor
```json
{
  "patient": 1,  // patient ID
  "doctor": 1,   // doctor ID
  "notes": "Follow-up in 2 weeks"
}
```

## Notes & Known Issues

- If you get CORS errors, check the CORS settings in settings.py
- Remember to include your JWT token in the Authorization header
- This is a assignment small  project, so expect some rough edges

## TODO (maybe someday)
- [ ] Add appointment scheduling
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Add better validation
- [ ] Write actual tests ðŸ˜…
